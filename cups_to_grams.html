            Since the 1960s, cups have been hardly ever used in recipes in the UK. In older UK recipes,
            the imperial cup (284.131ml) is used instead of the more contemporary metric cup (250ml),
            which is now used in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the rest of the Commonwealth.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the US, it is 240ml on the nutritional label but 236.59ml in recipes. Having you so far?
            Before you've even cracked an egg, the mayhem starts.

            Given the uncertainty surrounding cup measurements, weighing food in grams becomes a more simpler and more
            precise method of cooking.
            Additionally, it aids in preventing your cake from looking like a cross between a chocolate omelette and a
            concrete slab.
            Because of how firmly you put the ingredient in, the origin of your cups, and whether the top is level or
            piled,

        <h2>How to convert cups to grams</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on the ingredients makes the conversion from cups to grams more complicated than other units. So
            we're here to help you
        </p>
        <p>
            This <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/cups-to-grams">cups to grams</a> converter can help you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="formula">grams = cups x 236.588236 x material density</span><br>
            <p>Where:</p>

            <p>1 US legal cup = 240 ml </p>

            <p>1 US customary cup = 236.5882365 ml</p>

            <p>1 UK, AU, NZ, CA, ZA metric cup = 250 mL</p>

            <p>1 c = 236.58823648491 g</p>

            <p>Density depends on the material of the ingredients. </p>

            <p>Thus, if the recipe reads 1/3 cup of all-purpose flour, and we know its density is 0.529 g/ml, we have:</p>

            <p>1/3 x 236.588236 x 0.529 = 41.72 g</p>
        </p>
